# Split Data

This notebook performs a stratified split of the data into test and train sets.


## Setup

```py
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

```py
IN_PATH = "data/2-generate_features.csv"
pokedex = pd.read_csv(IN_PATH)
```

## Split

```py
train, test = train_test_split(
    pokedex,
    test_size=0.2,
    shuffle=True,
    random_state=441,
    stratify=pokedex["type_1"],
)
```

```py
print(len(train))
train.head()
```

```py
print(len(test))
test.head()
```

To verify stratification, we count the breakdown per class:

```py
types = set(pokedex["type_1"])
for t in types:
    train_count = (train["type_1"] == t).sum()
    test_count = (test["type_1"] == t).sum()
    total = train_count + test_count
    print(f"{t:<10} {train_count/total:.2f} : {test_count/total:.2f}  (total: {total})")
```

## Save Results

```py
OUT_PATH = "data/3-split_data"
TRAIN_PATH = f"{OUT_PATH}.train.csv"
TEST_PATH = f"{OUT_PATH}.test.csv"
train.to_csv(TRAIN_PATH, index=False)
test.to_csv(TEST_PATH, index=False)
```
